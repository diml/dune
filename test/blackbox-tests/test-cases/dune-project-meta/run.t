Test the various new fields inside the dune-project file.

The `dune build` should work.

Fatal error with opam file that is not listed in the dune-project file:

  $ dune build @install --root bad-opam-file --auto-promote
  Entering directory 'bad-opam-file'
  File "foo.opam", line 1, characters 0-0:
  Error: This opam file doesn't have a corresponding (package ...) stanza in the
  dune-project_file. Since you have at least one other (package ...) stanza in
  your dune-project file, you must a (package ...) stanza for each opam package
  in your project.

Check that the version is preserved when it is only written in the
opam files. This happens in tarball created by dune-release, or after
a `dune subst`.

  $ mkdir preserve-version
